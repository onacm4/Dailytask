Here's how the script works:

It imports the datetime module to get the current timestamp.
The track_task function takes a task as input, gets the current timestamp, and appends it to a file called "task_log.txt" along with the task description.
The main function is the entry point of the script. It prompts the user to enter tasks until they choose to quit by entering 'q'.
Each task entered by the user is passed to the track_task function for tracking.
The script appends the task and timestamp to the "task_log.txt" file.
After the task is tracked, it displays a success message.
The script can be run by executing the main function.
To use this script:

Copy the script and save it as a Python file (e.g., task_tracker.py).
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
Run the script by entering python task_tracker.py.
Enter your tasks as prompted. To quit, enter 'q'.
The tasks will be saved in the "task_log.txt" file in the same directory as the script.
